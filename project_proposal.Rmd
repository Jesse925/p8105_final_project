Analyses of the distribution and possible influence factors of motor vehicle collisions/crashes in New York City (NYC)


* The motivation for this project


* The intended final products


* The anticipated data sources


* The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

**Planned analyses:** Analyze the distributions of vehicle accident in different boroughs in NYC. Analyze the associations between each vehicle accident with reasons, times, locations, etc. Try to find out factor importance for each variable.

**Planned visualizations:** Accident heat map indicating the location and time of incidence happened in each area in NYC. Comparisons of incidence rates in different boroughs.

**Challenges:**  Is it possible to find a statistical model to make any useful predictions?

* The planned timeline

Nov.7 - Nov. 14: Tidy the dataset, start doing the planned analyses.


Nov.14 - Nov. 21: Keep working on the analyses and start doing planned visualizations using the obtained results.

Nov.21 - Nov.28: Start making the website and writing the report.

Nov.28 - Dce.5: Finalize the report/website, finish making the screencast.

Dec. 5: Submission of the report/website/screencast.
