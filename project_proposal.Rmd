### The tentative project title



### The motivation for this project



### The intended final products



### The anticipated data sources

Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-2018  from DATA.GOV (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015)

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

**Planned analyses:** Analyze the distributions of vehicle accident in different boroughs in NYC. Analyze the associations between each vehicle accident with reasons, times, locations, etc. Try to find out factor importance for each variable. Logistic regression.

**Planned visualizations:** 

1) Accident heat map indicating the location and time of incidence happened in each area in NYC. 

2) Vehicle type vs. crash incident rate

3) Time vs. crash incident rate

4) Incident reason vs. injury/death rate (bar chart)

5) TBD (Boxplot)

**Challenges:** 

### The planned timeline

* Nov.7 - Nov. 14: Tidy the dataset, start doing the planned analyses.

* Nov.14 - Nov. 21: Keep working on the analyses and start doing planned visualizations using the obtained results.

* Nov.21 - Nov.28: Start making the website and writing the report.

* Nov.28 - Dce.5: Finalize the report/website, finish making the screencast.

* Dec. 5: Submission of the report/website/screencast.
